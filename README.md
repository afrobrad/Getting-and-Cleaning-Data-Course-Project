# Outline
This repository contains the work completed for the "Getting and Cleaning Data Course" project which is part of the John Hokpins Data Science Specialization on Coursera taught by J.Leek, R.Peng and B.Caffo.

The objective of the project was to "..demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set".

Project Data Deliverables:

- A tidy version of the of original data set including:   
  - Merged training and test  
  - Only mean and standard deviation fields for each measurement  
  - Descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
  - Data labelled with descriptive variable names  
- A second, independent tidy data set including:  
  - the average of each variable for each activity and each subject  

A data set was chosen from a previous study conducted on "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" by Davide Anguita et al at
